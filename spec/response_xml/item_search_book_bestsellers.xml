I first saw Randy on televison delivering his, Last Lecture, I thought he was incredibly courageous!  His realization for the need to start creating more memories for his young children in the face of his terminal illness is priceless! His whole story is touching. I feel it was brilliant that Randy Pausch could think outside of his personal self and share what he was thinking with so many people. Admitting that the lecture was really just for his kids, we all learned something about the importance of leaving a legacy for those we love. Thank you Randy for sharing your story and making yourself immortal to your kids!

Randy is brave, honest, incredibly intelligent, thoughtful, amusing and so many other adjectives I could go on forever writing.  I am a skin cancer survivor and obviously I hope it never comes back but if it ever did I would think of how Randy dealt with his cancer to give me courage and strength.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading every single chapter of his book.  There were so many lessons learned that everyone could benefit from considering.  Randy's family and friends should be so proud of all his accomplishments and for being who he is.  People say our purpose in life is to do something to make the world a better place for us having been in it and Randy has done that so many times over.

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them. And while they speak, audiences can't help but mull the same question: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy? &lt;P&gt;When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave--"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams"--wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because "time is all you have...and you may find one day that you have less than you think"). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living. &lt;P&gt;In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humor, inspiration and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=left&gt; &lt;span class="h1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions for Randy Pausch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/a-plus/Pausch_Randy_300._V12349126_.jpg" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"&gt;We were shy about barging in on Randy Pausch's valuable time to ask him a few questions about his expansion of his famous Last Lecture into the book by the same name, but he was gracious enough to take a moment to answer. (See Randy to the right with his kids, Dylan, Logan, and Chloe.) As anyone who has watched the lecture or read the book will understand, the really crucial question is the last one, and we weren't surprised to learn that the "secret" to winning giant stuffed animals on the midway, like most anything else, is sheer persistence. &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Amazon.com:&lt;/strong&gt; I apologize for asking a question you must get far more often than you'd like, but how are you feeling? &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pausch:&lt;/strong&gt; The tumors are not yet large enough to affect my health, so all the problems are related to the chemotherapy. I have neuropathy (numbness in fingers and toes), and varying degrees of GI discomfort, mild nausea, and fatigue. Occasionally I have an unusually bad reaction to a chemo infusion (last week, I spiked a 103 fever), but all of this is a small price to pay for walkin' around. &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Amazon.com:&lt;/strong&gt; Your lecture at Carnegie Mellon has reached millions of people, but even with the short time you apparently have, you wanted to write a book. What did you want to say in a book that you weren't able to say in the lecture? &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pausch:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the lecture was written quickly--in under a week. And it was time-limited. I had a great six-hour lecture I could give, but I suspect it would have been less popular at that length ;-). &lt;p&gt; A book allows me to cover many, many more stories from my life and the attendant lessons I hope my kids can take from them. Also, much of my lecture at Carnegie Mellon focused on the professional side of my life--my students, colleagues and career. The book is a far more personal look at my childhood dreams and all the lessons I've learned. Putting words on paper, I've found, was a better way for me to share all the yearnings I have regarding my wife, children and other loved ones. I knew I couldn't have gone into those subjects on stage without getting emotional. &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon.com:&lt;/strong&gt; You talk about the importance--and the possibility!--of following your childhood dreams, and of keeping that childlike sense of wonder. But are there things you didn't learn until you were a grownup that helped you do that? &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pausch:&lt;/strong&gt; That's a great question. I think the most important thing I learned as I grew older was that you can't get anywhere without help. That means people have to want to help you, and that begs the question: What kind of person do other people seem to want to help? That strikes me as a pretty good operational answer to the existential question: "What kind of person should you try to be?" &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Amazon.com:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the things that struck me most about your talk was how many &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; people you talked about. You made me want to meet them and work with them--and believe me, I wouldn't make much of a computer scientist. Do you think the people you've brought together will be your legacy as well? &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pausch:&lt;/strong&gt; Like any teacher, my students are my biggest professional legacy. I'd like to think that the people I've crossed paths with have learned something from me, and I know I learned a great deal from them, for which I am very grateful. Certainly, I've dedicated a lot of my teaching to helping young folks realize how they need to be able to work with other people--especially other people who are very different from themselves. &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Amazon.com:&lt;/strong&gt; And last, the most important question: What's the secret for knocking down those milk bottles on the midway? &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pausch:&lt;/strong&gt; Two-part answer:&lt;br/&gt;      1) long arms&lt;br/&gt;      2) discretionary income / persistence&lt;p&gt; Actually, I was never good at the milk bottles. I'm more of a ring toss and softball-in-milk-can guy, myself. More seriously, though, most people try these games once, don't win immediately, and then give up. I've won *lots* of midway stuffed animals, but I don't ever recall winning one on the very first try. Nor did I expect to. That's why I think midway games are a great metaphor for life. &lt;/p&gt;</Content></EditorialReview><EditorialReview><Source>Book Description</Source><Content>&lt;b&gt;"We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand." &lt;br&gt;--Randy Pausch&lt;/b&gt; &lt;P&gt;A lot of professors give talks titled "The Last Lecture."

It is interesting to read of her background and career highlights. However, I felt that she hit below the belt in trashing former and long-dead colleagues (Frank McGee). This is not to say that her comments were wrong but attacking people when they are down -- especially 6-feet under down-- is unprofessional. It is also cruel to their families and loved ones left behind. As to her affair with Sen Brooke, I had no issue with their bi-racial love affair. But, again, did she ever take into account the sensibilities of his children, grand-children, etc. She went out of her way to respect her daughter's right-to-privacy. At least she asked permission before writing the "Hardest Chapter..." I thought this was, ultimately,  a not-so-subtle way to promote her daughter's current business venture, a for-profit camp for wayward rich kids---cash, checks, credit cards only. Insurance not accepted. A final note, on her book promotion tour, she declines to discuss Sen. Brooke or Star Jones. Then why include them in the first place--except maybe to sell books!? Wait for the paperback version!</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>030726646X</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2EAZRH1F3G6KN</CustomerId><TotalVotes>2</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>AUDITION</Summary><Content>I LOVE THIS BOOK.

&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Walters...has been my hero since my early teens...I just loved everything about her...I would often envision Ms. Walters interviewing me...now her book...makes me really understand this amazing woman...I love her even more....and..how brave of her..to share her authentic self with all of us...and to reveal her own secrets..</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Product Description</Source><Content>&lt;i&gt;Young people starting out in television sometimes say to me: &amp;#8220;I want to be you.&amp;#8221; My stock reply is always: &amp;#8220;Then you have to take the whole package.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, at last, the most important woman in the history of television journalism gives us that &amp;#8220;whole package,&amp;#8221; in her inspiring and riveting memoir. After more than forty years of interviewing heads of state, world leaders, movie stars, criminals, murderers, inspirational figures, and celebrities of all kinds, Barbara Walters has turned her gift for examination onto herself to reveal the forces that shaped her extraordinary life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barbara Walters&amp;#8217;s perception of the world was formed at a very early age. Her father, Lou Walters, was the owner and creative mind behind the legendary Latin Quarter nightclub, and it was his risk-taking lifestyle that gave Barbara her first taste of glamour. It also made her aware of the ups and downs, the insecurities, and even the tragedies that can occur when someone is willing to take great risks, for Lou Walters didn&amp;#8217;t just make several fortunes&amp;#8212;he also lost them. Barbara learned early about the damage that such an existence can do to relationships&amp;#8212;between husband and wife as well as between parent and child. Through her roller-coaster ride of a childhood, Barbara had a close companion, her mentally challenged sister, Jackie. True, Jackie taught her younger sister much about patience and compassion, but Barbara also writes honestly about the resentment she often felt having a sister who was so &amp;#8220;different&amp;#8221; and the guilt that still haunts her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this&amp;#8212;the financial responsibility for her family, the fear, the love&amp;#8212;played a large part in the choices she made as she grew up: the friendships she developed, the relationships she had, the marriages she tried to make work. Ultimately, thanks to her drive, combined with a decent amount of luck, she began a career in television. And what a career it has been! Against great odds, Barbara has made it to the top of a male-dominated industry. She was the first woman cohost of the &lt;i&gt;Today&lt;/i&gt; show, the first female network news coanchor, the host and producer of countless top-rated &lt;i&gt;Specials,&lt;/i&gt; the star of &lt;i&gt;20/20,&lt;/i&gt; and the creator and cohost of &lt;i&gt;The View&lt;/i&gt;. She has not just interviewed the world&amp;#8217;s most fascinating figures, she has become a part of their world. These are just a few of the names that play a key role in Barbara&amp;#8217;s life, career, and book: Yasir Arafat, Warren Beatty, Menachem Begin, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chávez, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Roy Cohn, the Dalai Lama, Princess Diana, Katharine Hepburn, King Hussein, Angelina Jolie, Henry Kissinger, Monica Lewinsky, Richard Nixon, Rosie O&amp;#8217;Donnell, Christopher Reeve, Anwar Sadat, John Wayne . . . the list goes on and on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barbara Walters has spent a lifetime auditioning: for her bosses at the TV networks, for millions of viewers, for the most famous people in the world, and even for her own daughter, with whom she has had a difficult but ultimately quite wonderful and moving relationship. This book, in some ways, is her final audition, as she fully opens up both her private and public lives. In doing so, she has given us a story that is heartbreaking and honest, surprising and fun, sometimes startling, and always fascinating.</Content></EditorialReview></EditorialReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0786865652</ASIN><Title>Home: A Memoir of My Early Years</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>1401323189</ASIN><Title>Just Who Will You Be?: Big Question.

Fast forward five months, and my life is so much easier, my romantic relationship has turned a positive corner, my work-life has improved--in essence my whole life has simply become EASY. I look forward to reading more Eckhart and other likeminded books and continuing my spiritual journey toward a happier, more peaceful, better contributing and balanced life.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0452289963</ASIN><Rating>4</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1ZCTUJG6HUDJH</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>A New Earth Awakening to Your Life's Purpose</Summary><Content>This is a well written thought provoking book.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was disappointed to find a lot of repeat material from the author's earlier awesome book The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment. (I do see how the Power of Now ideas fit in with A New Earth.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Although some of the concepts are hard to grasp and are beyond me, the author's formula for creating a new earth consciousness is clear enough that anyone can benefit from it if they take the time. I greatly appreciate the simplicity of the practices he describes. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I revisit the many highlighted (by me) passages from both books nearly everyday and still find them interesting and helpful. Eckhart Tolle rocks!</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0452289963</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>AGWNUI1MJ7EV7</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>I have shifted!</Summary><Content>I have gotten so much out of this book in so many ways.  I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this book is.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As they say though you can't bring anyone with you.  This book will either make total sense to you and make your life better than you could have imagined or it will be complete rubbish.  It's not a quick fix.  It's a shifting of your mental being, your way of life.  I am so grateful to Mr. Tolle and Oprah!  I am much calmer, not stressed, less judgmental.  I am way more involved in my own life now!  I am a better parent, a better friend, a better human being!  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can not say enough about how wonderful this book is.  But that is just my opinion! </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0452289963</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1LPGOX8U6YWGG</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>Enlightening</Summary><Content>GET THIS BOOK! Everyone should read it! I've already read the book and followed along with Oprah and Eckhart during their live webcasts and decided to get the book on CD to share with my mom and other friends that don't have the time or ability to read (my mom's sight is damaged from diabetes), as well as keep on-hand to listen to while at work. It's so enlightening and truly does "awaken you to YOUR life's purpose". I can't even tell you how many ah-ha-moments I have had while reading the book and I promise, you will, too!  </Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>  &lt;span class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amazon.com Exclusive Content&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Click on the image below to download an exclusive essay by Eckhart Tolle, in .pdf format. &lt;p clear=all&gt; &lt;img border=0 src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/books/a-plus/tolle.jpg"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p clear=all&gt; &lt;span class="h1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More From Eckhart Tolle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;  &lt;tr align="center" valign="top" class="tiny"&gt; &lt;td width="33%"&gt; &lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577314808.01.MXXXXXXX.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td width="33%"&gt; &lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577311957.01.MXXXXXXX.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Practicing The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td width="33%"&gt; &lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/157731400X.01.MXXXXXXX.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Stillness Speaks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr align="center" valign="top" class="tiny"&gt; &lt;td width="33%"&gt; &lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577314867.01.MXXXXXXX.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Living a Life of Inner Peace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unabridged Audio CD&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td width="33%"&gt; &lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0743535472.01.MXXXXXXX.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gateways to Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Inner Life Series)&lt;br&gt;Audio CD&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td width="33%"&gt; &lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577315081.01.MXXXXXXX.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Eckhart Tolle's Findhorn Retreat: Stillness Amidst the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unabridged Audio CD&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;p&gt;</Content></EditorialReview><EditorialReview><Source>Book Description</Source><Content>The highly anticipated follow-up to the 2,000,000 copy bestselling inspirational book, &lt;i&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   With his bestselling spiritual guide &lt;i&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt;, Eckhart Tolle inspired millions of readers to discover the freedom and joy of a life lived "in the now." In &lt;i&gt;A New Earth&lt;/i&gt;, Tolle expands on these powerful ideas to show how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world. Tolle describes how our attachment to the ego creates the dysfunction that leads to anger, jealousy, and unhappiness, and shows readers how to awaken to a new state of consciousness and follow the path to a truly fulfilling existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   &lt;i&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/i&gt; was a question-and-answer handbook. &lt;i&gt;A New Earth&lt;/i&gt; has been written as a traditional narrative, offering anecdotes and philosophies in a way that is accessible to all. Illuminating, enlightening, and uplifting, A New Earth is a profoundly spiritual manifesto for a better way of life&amp;#151;and for building a better world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   &lt;b&gt;About the Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ECKHART TOLLE is a contemporary spiritual teacher who is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition. In his writing and seminars, he conveys a simple yet profound message with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters: There is a way out of suffering and into peace. Eckhart travels extensively, taking his teachings throughout the world.</Content></EditorialReview></EditorialReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>B0002T54K0</ASIN><Title>Post-it Highlighter

overview of ideals by a true Constitutionalist </Summary><Content>I first became interested in Ron Paul a couple of years ago and thought that he meant well but, I wasn't quite convinced that we should get rid of nearly every Federal governmental program available because I had been helped out by a couple of them over my lifetime...or so, I thought.  At the same time, I was studying International Relations (my major)classes and had become quite worried by some of the information I had gathered in my studies.  International Law is the subject of most worry due to the encroaching nature of the New World Order... I mean, United Nations. My apologies. There are numerous cases being tried from around the world in The Hague, The Netherlands that most often center on giving the UN more power and allowing the organization to usurp each individual nations' sovereignty.  I decided to delve deeper and the further I went, the more disturbed I became because of the sense of hopelessness and isolation one feels when learning that nearly everything that you had believed in since childhood was just an illusion.  Question what happened to WTC building no. 7. I bet most people don't even know that it fell too.  Main Stream Media is owned by only a few large companies... they couldn't possibly work together to keep valid information away from the "masses".  Please read this book but, do not stop there. Keep reading and looking for the truth because it is out there and unless we, the people, question this spoon fed reality then there is no one else.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0446537519</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>AULZPM0K56FEA</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>Great Read!!</Summary><Content>	This is a must read for all Americans.  Dr Paul's message is the right medicine for curing America's ills.  He describes plainly and in easy to understand language the need for returning our government to the principles of the Founding Fathers - sound money, economic freedom, a non-interventionist foreign policy, and secure civil rights.  This text will have influence for many years to come.  Long live the Freedom Revolution!</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0446537519</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2P6L9CP9WK4OI</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>Are we listening yet?</Summary><Content>Brilliant!

I had given up on the media and the Republicrats to yield a decent candidate.  Little did I know how bad the situation really was.  The great thing is that there is hope, that I've found people that really make sense.  They've turned me on to economics and political science, like I never thought I'd be.

His ideas are fantastic and what is ironic is that they are mostly ones that were practiced through out much of American history. And believe it or not America was a better country then than it is today (Relatively speaking of course...there are narrow minds that will jump on that opinion im sure). I will admit that this book is not for those who are afraid of change or revolution. People who are afraid of ideas like these would have been running for the hills in the Revolutionary War instead of running for the front lines like I would. I sincerely hope I get a chance to meet Dr. Paul someday and shake the hand of a real American Patriot.</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Product Description</Source><Content>&lt;STRONG&gt;This Much Is True: You Have Been Lied To.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;UL type=disc&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;LI MARGIN: 0in 1.5in 0pt 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in?&gt;The government is expanding. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;LI MARGIN: 0in 1.5in 0pt 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in?&gt;Taxes are increasing. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;LI MARGIN: 0in 1.5in 0pt 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in?&gt;More senseless wars are being planned. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;LI MARGIN: 0in 1.5in 0pt 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in?&gt;Inflation is ballooning. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;LI MARGIN: 0in 1.5in 0pt 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in?&gt;Our basic freedoms are disappearing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Founding Fathers didn't want any of this. In fact, they said so quite clearly in the Constitution of the &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;United States of America&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;. Unfortunately, that beautiful, ingenious, and revolutionary document is being ignored more and more in &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Washington&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;. If we are to enjoy peace, freedom, and prosperity once again, we absolutely must return to the principles upon which &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; was founded. But finally, there is hope . . . &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In THE REVOLUTION,&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Texas&lt;/st1:State&gt; congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul has exposed the core truths behind everything threatening &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, from the &lt;I&gt;real &lt;/I&gt;reasons behind the collapse of the dollar and the looming financial crisis, to terrorism and the loss of our precious civil liberties. In this book, Ron Paul provides answers to questions that few even dare to ask. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Despite a media blackout, this septuagenarian physician-turned-congressman sparked a movement that has attracted a legion of young, dedicated, enthusiastic supporters . . . a phenomenon that has amazed veteran political observers and made more than one political rival envious. Candidates across &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; are already running as "Ron Paul Republicans."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Dr. Paul cured my apathy," says a popular campaign sign.

You see "fat free" this and "lite" this in all the ingredients but when combined the taste is so amazing you honestly do not realize what you are eating is healthier than the alternatives.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I just made the "Dream Puffs" tonight and I was floored - so freaking good.  Sweet, puffy donut-like pastry with cold creamy filling for only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat?   Ridiculous! (As long as you don't eat the whole tray, lol)  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the imitation recipe of the Taco Bell crunch wrap supreme and was equally impressed.  You get a pretty big portion of (delicious) food that filled me up and was only 220 calories and 4.5 grams of fat.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is that there are a LOT of common ingredients amongst the different recipes, so you won't find yourself buying a whole huge thing of vanilla soy milk and going what on earth am I going to do with the rest of this?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Finally.... I'd recommended this to the single or the couple.  I live by myself and half the time I don't feel like cooking because 1. most recipes just make too much and 2. I'm too lazy.  A lot of these are written for one or two servings so that is very convenient for me and almost all of them are really simple.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0312377428</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1NX6GYKQL85PH</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-21</Date><Summary>Great for singles who are watching their weight</Summary><Content>I am a college student and I recently started weight watchers.  I bought this book on a whim last week and I love it.  I have already tried lots of the recipes and look forward to trying more.  My favorite recipe so far is the spicy crispy chicken, which was delicious, and I have enjoyed everything that I have made.  I even served the egg rolls to some of my friends who aren't dieting and they seemed to like them.  The book is great for singles because it has lots of recipes that make 1-2 servings and the ingredient lists are pretty simple so you shouldn't have to go out and buy lots of random stuff.  Also if you are on weight watchers, the points for all the recipes are on the hungry girl website as well as pictures.  All in all, I would recommend this book and if you already have it, I hope you are enjoying it as much as I am.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0312377428</ASIN><Rating>4</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2LL4AESSB83VD</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>Wonderful recipes</Summary><Content>Great cookbook.

I love this book because most of the recipes are simple. They don't take a lot of preperation or cooking time. I am a very picky eater and I have loved almost every recipe that I've tried so far. Loved the fiber chicken strips. Loved the southwest surprise soup. Loved the pot pie. It's the best! I also loved the onion soup. I did not like the fudge. It just wasn't sweet or "chocolaty" enough. I don't expect to like every recipe though. I recommend this book to people who don't like to cook, are watching their calories and want new recipe ideas or makeovers for their fast food/high calorie favorites. </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0312377428</ASIN><Rating>4</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2K71J7YK6K91A</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-19</Date><Summary>Not bad...</Summary><Content>I purchased this cookbook about 2 weeks ago, though I do not frequent the Hungry Girl site. It's a great "junk food" recipe book for people who have to watch fat and calories.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I know HG takes a lot of heat for using processed food products in her recipes, and though this book does include some recipes requiring pre-packaged foods there is a surprising amount of them that don't (see the salad chapter). Some of the recipes are, in fact, surprisingly healthy. Squash fries and Sheperd's Pie being two of them.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I do do a lot of substituting though. I favor real milk over soy, low fat cheese over fat free, and I left the chili out of the nacho recipe because it sounded odd (I will replace with pinto beans the next time I make them). I will never use the shirataki noodles, I prefer the real thing as I am not a big carb counter.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that there are a lot of single serving recipes, because frankly my man hates diet food and I can't feed this stuff to my 1-year-old daughter who doesn't need a reduced-fat diet.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The recipes are simple, and for the most part, delicious.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So far I've tried:
&lt;br /&gt;Onion rings (an acceptable substitute)
&lt;br /&gt;Buffalo chicken salad (my favorite so far)
&lt;br /&gt;Death by chocolate cupcakes (very rich)
&lt;br /&gt;The nachos (good, though the cheese sauce was a strange consistancy)
&lt;br /&gt;and the PB Fudge (the only one I would not make again--it was awful)</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>&lt;p align=left&gt; &lt;span class="h1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit the Kitchen with &lt;i&gt;Hungry Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just because you're watching your waistline doesn't mean you need to go hungry.

NOT compare to Twilight!</Summary><Content>First of all, you can not start reading this book thinking it is Twilight.  I've read the reviews and most (if not all) of the 1 and 2 star reviews are comparing this to Twilight!  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Stephenie creates a fantastic world that is very believable.  I read the book through in one day because I just COULD NOT put it down!  The characters are very complex, but I had no trouble understanding them.  In fact, I felt like I knew exactly how they felt.  Jared and Melanie became one of my favorite couples - they are up there with Romeo and Juliet, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, and, yes, Edward and Bella.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not very many authors can break away from the "voice" they have found, especially with such a successful series as Twilight is.  I was very pleasantly surprised to discover Stephanie Meyer created a completely different voice - different feel, different characters - and still managed to write a TERRIFIC novel! </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0316068047</ASIN><Rating>3</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1HTBBMZFQP1J5</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>A Little Disappointed...</Summary><Content>I loved the Twilight Series (even though I'm a little older than 'young adult' :)  but was somewhat disappointed in The Host.  I agree with some of the other reviews written about the beginning being very slow, and I myself, almost put the book down until I read other comments stating the book gets better after the first 80-90 pages or so. If I hadn't read these comments, I probably wouldn't have finished the book. Unfortunately, it took quite a while to get going, but I did like after the first several chapters. I am a fan of Stephanie Meyer since reading the Twilight books. I can't wait for Breaking Dawn and the upcoming movie. Hopefully she will not stop the Twilight Series.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0316068047</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A10L3PK1L4XBOS</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>Excellent read!</Summary><Content>You go into this thinking "Okay, science fiction.. got it".. but you leave with an entirely different thought on this book..

That is exactly the same type of unique perspective Stephanie Meyer's presents in her recent book, The Host.  And as with all of Meyers books, you are always excited to explore the novel approach she takes to every one of her stories/characters!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The beginning of this book was a little hard to get excited about...  I found that looking through the confused eyes of the alien was a little unsettling initially, and I just struggled to care about what happened to Melanie/Wanderer.  However, about halfway through the book I began to truly understand the Wanda - Melanie - Jared - Ian relationship, and really began to look forward to what would happen next.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that I was not all that impressed with how Meyer's developed the supporting characters around Wanda/Melanie... when one of her new "friends" actually dies, it took me several minutes to remind myself as to why she cared about that person so much.  Although, in hindsight, I think I thought this same thing about the less important characters in the Twilight series.  Meyer's tends to pick about three characters to develop with any depth, and other supporting characters are just declared as important to the main character... I suppose taking the time to develop those relationships would take too long and make the story even longer than it already is.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This book is VERY long, but it has a lot of great discussion points that would make it great for a young adult or tween book group.  Topics such as prejudice, environmental adaptation, and human growth through strife would be great in any lit group.  I could also see a lot of focus on some of the colorful imagery that Meyers uses to describe her environment/mood... she can really use some great vocabulary!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Although Meyers brought up the topic of sex briefly in the beginning of this book, the message of responsibility in this area was very apparent.  I also didn't think the intensity of romantic relationship was as prevalent in this book as what was presented in the Twilight series.... this has made it much easier to justify The Host on a summer reading list to my younger students.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don't think The Host was as good as Twilight, however it was a fascinating read and I was happy I had the opportunity to explore it.  The ending, although a bit predictable, did make me smile and is sure to make the majority of readers happy!  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure if Meyer's is anticipating a sequel to The Host, but personally, I hope she leaves this one as a stand alone and gets back to making the Twilight books!  (You gotta love Edward!)  If you had to pick between those and this one, enjoy Twilight first and then, once you are finished with that series, make time for Host.    </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0316068047</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>ALY45IYZ3C6RZ</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-20</Date><Summary>Meyer does it again</Summary><Content>An older fan of the author's Twilight series, I was extremely excited for her first adult novel to make its release, and I was not disappointed. The Host is just as gripping as her earlier series but with a little bit more edge to add a level of maturity that sets this novel apart from the rest. There are some similarities in theme to her earlier novels as well as the way she approaches the genre, adding so much humanity to a science fiction that it doesn't feel like you are reading a science fiction. Though the novel takes some time setting the stage, the entire second half of the novel is hard to put down, never short on excitement and emotion. I feel that whether you are a fan of Meyer or not, it is a great summer read.</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>Amazon Best of the Month, May 2008: Stephenie Meyer, creator of the phenomenal teen-vamp &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; series, takes paranormal romance into alien territory in her first adult novel. Those wary of sci-fi or teen angst will be pleasantly surprised by this mature and imaginative thriller, propelled by equal parts action and emotion. A species of altruistic parasites has peacefully assumed control of the minds and bodies of most humans, but feisty Melanie Stryder won't surrender her mind to the alien soul called Wanderer. Overwhelmed by Melanie's memories of fellow resistor Jared, Wanderer yields to her body's longing and sets off into the desert to find him. Likely the first love triangle involving just two bodies, it's unabashedly romantic, and the characters (human and alien) genuinely endearing. Readers intrigued by this familiar-yet-alien world will gleefully note that the story's end leaves the door open for a sequel--or another series. &lt;i&gt;--Mari Malcolm&lt;/i&gt;</Content></EditorialReview><EditorialReview><Source>Product Description</Source><Content>The author of the &lt;I&gt;Twilight &lt;/I&gt;series of # 1 bestsellers delivers her brilliant first novel for adults: a gripping story of love and betrayal in a future with the fate of humanity at stake. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away.

The publisher describes the book as "prophetic insight".  In reality, "The Post-American World" does not live up to such grandiose descriptions nor does it try to do so.  This book is not ground breaking in its ideas or its analysis.  The ideas expressed by Zakaria are familiar to anyone who reads the "Economist" or any number of books/publications that deal with economics and world affairs.  In addition Zakaria's analysis is quite superficial, tackling complex issues in two or three paragraphs and often times using anecdotal evidence to support his arguments.  This is not necessarily the result of flaws in Zakaria's ideas but rather comes from the fact that he has chosen to take on a broad and complex topic in just 272 pages.  This book is essentially a well written, 272 page essay intended to be a conversation starter not the final word.  If the reader is willing to accept it as such, then "The Post-American World" is an enjoyable and easy read that will hopefully spur lively debate about America's role in this new century.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>039306235X</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A3T2KWW6R04GV8</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-19</Date><Summary>Easy reading, very informative, interesting insight</Summary><Content>Interesting insight into the the "Post Amercian" World.

Through this book he seeks to broaden his claim to expertise, not merely as an analyst of the war on terrorism but as a seer in every sense. For that ambition alone, this book is fatally flawed. It attempts a subject so stupendous that even a lifelong expert like Paul Kennedy came up short with his 'Rise and Fall of Great Powers.' So Fareed surely does, although the writing is fluid, flowing far better and faster than any writer other than Thomas Friedman.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The book covers the rise of India, China, and the 'rest,' although it never really focuses on other countries enough. It gives anecdotes as well as hard evidence of how and why the world has speeded up its growth and how and why the US is falling behind, not because Americans are doing something wrong but because the rest of the world is doing so much right.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The book is so well written and likely to be so popular that it in all probability will end up on college curriculums, much like Thomas Friedman and Howard Zinn have. Yet it is flawed to the point of being dangerous and is so for the following reasons.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. It stands to teach political economy to millions of people who shall never take a class in political economy. So they would never realize that Fareed has no idea what he is talking about when he compares the 'Rise of the Rest' with the 'rise of the United States' and the 'rise of the Western World.' Well the US rose upon a stunning technological revolution which it itself produced, starting with the telegraph, telephone, airplane, the radio, the TV and the Internet. Neither China nor India has ever produced any substantial technology except body shopping. To this date, there is no evidence that a power can rise without such innovative intrinsic achievements. In that sense then, China and India are more like Spain, building palaces out of the gold of the New World, and headed to become like Japan, rich and capable but rarely a leader in any domain. That is a lesson of political economy he should have read before embarking on this book.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2. Fareed obviously reads vigorously and cuts newspaper articles voraciously. That is obvious in his sources and anecdotes. But those are really clumsy ways to attempt a subject so significant as the rise and fall of nations. Yes China's Macao is bigger than America's Las Vegas, but who but the poor of the world ever go to Macao. Yes India has the world's largest refinery, but the machinery and technology is all borrowed from the West. Yes Dubai is building the world's tallest building, but who cares, Silicon Valley has no building taller than 20 stories! Yes Singapore has the largest Ferris Wheel, but they are copying American culture. Yes a Mexican is the world's richest man but his cell phone empire has never produced a half way decent cell phone or transmission technology. Yes India has more billionaire's than any country outside the US, and no Fareed, you have it wrong, few if any are self made. I read it in Forbes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In sum thus, both for its historical misjudgments and its static economic analysis, Fareed's book should be avoided. And if it is ever turned to paperback, then Fareed must correct the fatal flaw of his premise. Corrupt, centralized systems like China and India, growing fast only because they are just getting around to provide food and water to their people, can never overtake a free people, who vote in freedom, and think in freedom and innovate in freedom. Not even if the stock market is silly enough to value America's Dupont less than India's Reliance, or Mexican cell phone companies more than American ones, or value Bombay more valuable than New York City. Those are short term distortions. </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>039306235X</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1JS76EQAHPHW4</CustomerId><TotalVotes>4</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-17</Date><Summary>One World</Summary><Content>An excellent book in predicting how the world will look like in 20-30 years.  Globalization is the story of our age.  Mr. Zakaria's background and world travel gave him an advantageous vintage point in assessing the world affairs and the trend for the next few decades.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Average reader will greatly benefit from reading the book.  For example, the rise of China and India will affect the world in a very fundamental way because of the combined population of 2.5 billion. Globalization is not a blessing for everyone, it is rather harmful for the standard of living for 80% of the people in the developed world.  But it is important to realize that it is not possible to stop such a trend, just as it is not morally correct to deny the right to development for China and India.  Chinese and Indians are equal humans as the people in the west, they are not sub humans, they have every right to pursue happiness in life, to get rich, to produce, to consume, to release CO2 just like all of us living in the west.  Even though all this CO2 will accelerate climate change which is harmful for all, how can we ask the Chinese or Indian to maintain one fourth to one tenth the amount CO2 released per person as we Americans?  Should they take bus while they can drive, should they not take warm bath while they can?  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you are not happy with such a trend (rise of the rest), the most important thing that you can get from this book is the realization that it is inevitable.  We must come to grips with the reality and try to make the best of it.  The optimism he projects in his book is not the key point, he may not even really believe in it. Dislocations are wide spread in rural America and the small towns of America, he must know about it.  But again, what can you do?  Why should a worker in Oklahoma make 10 times the salary than the worker in Zhejiang, China while they both make 100 pairs of socks a day?  They should be paid about the same - as long as the socks can be moved around, meaning "free trade".

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, for the author, this is work that must be left unsaid and insinuated from deep within the subtext of the book, unsaid and insinuated in "metaphorical relief." As he puts it, it is not "the "fall of America, but the rise of the rest." 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who takes that backhanded insult at face value, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn I want to sell you? This demeaning backhanded way of telling us that our country is in very serious decline sounds like the kind of reverse psychology one uses on a young child who will not eat his vegetables. But it is the only way to get any kind of self-criticism down the ultra-sensitive American palate. Its the same maneuver that Denish d' Souza, one of the darling of the rightwing, used so deftly in his equally insulting "What's so Good About America?" Again, under the pretext of praising America, he too had to tuck the truth in between the lines amid so much insincere "pro-American groveling." 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And why not? Somehow, no matter how untrue or how superficial, we tend to eat fawning compliments like they are breakfast cereal. But any criticism is un-patriotic and un-American. Fareed is no ones fool.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As brilliant as he is, the author has never been allowed to tell the full truth, even on the weekend news pundit shows. The inferior minds among his colleagues just keep censoring him into non-existence. I notice that even though he is clearly the most brilliant in our generation of journalists, his appearances are becoming less and less frequent. I wonder why? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is not a "Zakaria problem," but an "American problem." And to paraphrase Jack Nicholson in one of the most famous lines in all movie-dome: "Americans can't handle the truth!" Fareed, to repeat another of my favorite clichés from the movie Munich, is just "the voice in our heads telling us what we already know: That while America has led the world into the 21st Century it has suddenly and abruptly made a u-turn ducking its head back into the sands of its own dark ages. Beating its breast with all kinds of new weapons but scared to come out of its hole: [The world is going off and leaving us in the dust: Is this really the way we want to go down? Has anyone seen Kuala Lumpur, or Dubai, or even Singapore or Seoul lately? They all make America cities look like something from the Middle Ages.]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The evidence of our decline is everywhere: (1) In the 21st Century, we are still fighting the Scopes trial, and are losing? Intelligent Design is slowly gaining an undeserved prominence on par with the Science of Evolution. Four of the Republican candidates admitted in the Presidential debates on international television that they do not believe in evolution. (2) Like the most famous modern day Neanderthal we love to hate, Saudi born, Osama bin Laden, we too love our guns, god, and hate gays, and just for good measure, also throw racism into that mix. (3) The very fact that GW Bush was elected for two terms should have been a strong enough hint that something is terribly wrong with the "last standing superpower." Even if we were trying to, we could not have picked a worse representative of the best America has to offer. (4) But worse of all, America has become a "fair weather democracy." It no longer completely believes in it founding ideas and ideals. It only believes in them when they benefit certain protected American subgroups, otherwise, all bets are off. To wit, we will cheat to win elections; torture prisoners and throw away due process; neglect our own poor; turn the clock back on hard won civil rights; and sell out not just our democracy, but all of our seed corn too -- our future -- to the highest bidder. Our politicians have become whores for the moneyed interests.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If we were half the nation we tell ourselves we are, then Fareed Zakaria would not have had to "dumb-down" this book and write in reverse psychological diplomatic code to tell us what we already know.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Fifty stars.</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Product Description</Source><Content>&lt;B&gt;One of our most distinguished thinkers argues that the "rise of the rest" is the great story of our time.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"This is not a book about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else." So begins Fareed Zakaria's important new work on the era we are now entering. Following on the success of his best-selling &lt;I&gt;The Future of Freedom&lt;/I&gt;, Zakaria describes with equal prescience a world in which the United States will no longer dominate the global economy, orchestrate geopolitics, or overwhelm cultures. He sees the "rise of the rest"&amp;#151;the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and many others&amp;#151;as the great story of our time, and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings, biggest dams, largest-selling movies, and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States. This economic growth is producing political confidence, national pride, and potentially international problems. How should the United States understand and thrive in this rapidly changing international climate? What does it mean to live in a truly global era? Zakaria answers these questions with his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination.</Content></EditorialReview></EditorialReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>1400065089</ASIN><Title>The Second World: Empires and Influence in the New Global Order</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>030726923X</ASIN><Title>The Return of History and the End of Dreams</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>B0007XAW76</ASIN><Title>The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>1400042437</ASIN><Title>Terror and Consent : The Wars for the Twenty-First Century</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0670019070</ASIN><Title>Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism</Title></SimilarProduct></SimilarProducts><BrowseNodes><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>2592</BrowseNodeId><Name>Business &amp;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The story allows for the theology to be read easily.

&lt;br /&gt;well, I had to get this book. I was very disappointed and at times wanted to throw it in the trash...There's so many errors, (scripturally) that it just ruined the whole book for me. UGH!!
&lt;br /&gt;And I was a little turned off at the end where they want you to tell everyone you know that this is the greatest book you've ever read, called the Missy Project. Come on, I see $$$ signs. It's not the greatest book and why waste your time on errors and filling your mind with thoughts of God made in an author's own imagine that's not even true. It would have been better if they would not have labled it "Christian". </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0964729237</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2PEX60FHXSF18</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-19</Date><Summary>WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All I want to do is read it over and over and over and over </Summary><Content>Well so far I've bought 10 copies of this book to give away to my friends, and everyone so far that as read this book say's it has literally changed, not only their lives, but the deception they have believed for so long!... FREEDOM! is not just a thought, it's REAL!
&lt;br /&gt;  I have never! read a book so profound! in all my life, and I read a lot of books.....
&lt;br /&gt;  If you are the kind of person who has been seeking God and wanting a closer relationship with Him,and not sure how to go about it, or what a real relationship looks like, this is the book for you..not only will you gain a heart revelation of true, real relationships, you will also discover emoitional healing, true Forgiveness, good vs evil thinking, and a lot more....
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;I'm like the other reviewer "only 5 stars" no way this is a "10" all the way! AWESOME!
&lt;br /&gt;  For those of you who truly would like to understand what  "LOVE" "looks like" and have been decived in this area like I have... READ THIS BOOK!!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;WARRING:  Its only for those who can handle taking God out of their box of religiosity that THEY put Him in....
&lt;br /&gt;   
&lt;br /&gt;   So far I'm 10 for 10 on my freinds who have read this book, and called me saying I love you! I love you! Thank you so much! you have know Idea what this book has done for me. Yes I do! because it has done the same for me! Parents are giving it their teenages to read and they want to buy copies and give to their friends...
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;   I am reading it again for the second time and I keep recieving more truth and deeper revelation of my Papas heart for me! Yes all I want to call Him now is "Papa" becaue He is particularly FOND of me you see! and so much more I will never ever ever again be a disapointment to my Papa.

Four years later in the midst of his Great Sadness, Mack receives a suspicious note, apparently from God, inviting him back to that shack for a weekend.    Against his better judgment he arrives at the shack on a wintry afternoon and walks back into his darkest nightmare.  What he finds there will change Mack's world forever.    In a world where religion seems to grow increasingly irrelevant "The Shack" wrestles with the timeless question, "Where is God in a world so filled with unspeakable pain?"  The answers Mack gets will astound you and perhaps transform you as much as it did him.

&lt;br /&gt;Percy and friends have it hard this time. Annabeth has been chosen to lead a team into the labyrinth, which they have discovered an entry in Camp Half-Blood. Grover has been given a week to fine the God, Pan, or his searcher's license will be revoked. Luke is an ever present threat, as well as Kronos. But I can't tell too much more, or I will give it all away.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This series is still good. In fact, it's so good. I devoured this book in about two sittings and now I should reread it because, wow... it's so good! I feel like Riordan is starting to go downward on his story arc, so I believe we can expect one, maybe two more books, and that is it. That said, these are quite popular, and Riordan may be compelled to pull an L. Frank Baum and just continue to write the series. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;These are still one of my favorites. I like them more than Harry Potter, still, because it's Greek mythology and that has always been a favorite of mine. I will be sad to see these go. That said, we have a little while before that happens. I'm so glad that Riordan continues to write this, and I am so glad that it is snowballing in popularity. I love these books. I loved this book. I am so happy about it all. </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>1423101464</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A3AFCZTWL5VNNR</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-05-19</Date><Summary>This is a wonderful series -</Summary><Content>Percy Jackson always knew he was different...turns out that he's a demi-god...that means the child of a god and a mortal - at a certain age, he gets the word to go to a camp for these kids - it's called appropriately Camp Half-Blood...
&lt;br /&gt;You know the Greek Gods - they were powerful and er, prolific...needless to say there are a lot of kids at the camp!
&lt;br /&gt;Each summer these kids go on a quest - things are happening - the Titans are trying to come back and defeat the Greek Gods - Yikes!
&lt;br /&gt;The kids of the camp have to enter the Labyrinth to stop the Titan revolt. They meet another child of Athena - Daedalus - remember Daedalus and his son Icarus? That's the guy - 
&lt;br /&gt;This book continues to amaze the adventure and Rick Riordan is amazingly accurate in his knowledge in Greek Mythology - I take my Hamilton book on mythology out and learn more and more every time I read one of Riordan's books.
&lt;br /&gt;Love Percy Jackson - OK the series is for kids...but us big kids really love the series too.
&lt;br /&gt;Long live Camp Half-Blood!

Several new gods are introduced, and the book picks up an ominous pace as it draws closer to the finale, and the determining battle between gods and Titans.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Percy Jackson has just been accepted to a new school. Again. And despite his every intention not to get kicked out of this one too, being a demigod with Poseidon as your father tends to attract trouble. And monsters, in the form of peppy-but-deadly cheerleaders. After accidentally starting a fire, Percy makes a break for it - along with a mortal girl, Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who has the unusual ability to see through the Mist, the substance that usually hides gods and monsters from mortal eyes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When he finally makes it back to Camp Half-Blood, Percy finds that all is not well there. His friend Grover is in danger of losing his lifelong dream, his friend Annabeth is treating him oddly, and - worst of all - Nico di Angelo, the half-blood son of Hades, is still at large, trying to bring back his dead sister in exchange for another, living soul.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But all of these pale in comparison to the danger of Kronos, whose followers are growing and whose resurrection is now imminent. When Annabeth is assigned a quest through the perilous Labyrinth of Daedalus, she takes Percy along for the ride - as well as Grover and Percy's Cyclops half-brother, Tyson.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is the most exciting and action-packed book yet, as the darkness closes in. Real losses and horrors are experienced in this one, both private and large-scale. It is clear that the final battle is drawing near, the battle in which - according to the prophecy - either Percy, or Nico di Angelo, will have a pivotal role to play in either the victory or destruction of Olympus and the gods.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Very good
