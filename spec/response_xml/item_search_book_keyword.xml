Kaye's Book Blog</Summary><Content>Reviews over Sandra Brown's PLAY DIRTY weren't exactly glowing here, causing me to be a bit skeptical prior to getting this book. For this reason, I went with the audio format. Normally I can stick with a bad book longer this way. But it turns out, this wasn't necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the book opens, Griff Burkett has just been let out of prison where he'd spent five years. He'd been a Cowboys quarterback, but threw a game in order to pay off gambling debts. From the getgo, he's not a likable character and maybe this was a turn-off to readers. Personally, I thought this was a brazen move - one that I appreciated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to the story, Foster Speakman, owner and CEO of SunSouth Airlines, and his wife, Laura, a wealthy, successful and wealthy couple. Early in their marriage, tragedy struck in the form of an auto accident, leaving Foster in a wheel chair. He's unable to have children, and this is where Burkett comes in. He is offered a job of impregnating his wife and not through vitro fertilization, but the old fashioned way. The catch is this job must remain secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad guy in this story is Stanley Rodarte. He's a cop whose mission is to tag Burkett for an unsolved murder that happened prior to Burkett's incarceration. Rodarte won't rest until Burkett is back behind bars, even if he has to play dirty to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I knew early who the murderer was, it was a great read with good solid characters. Sandra Brown never fails to entertain! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0743289358</ASIN><Rating>4</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2LZAYHM7OQEYW</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2008-02-19</Date><Summary>Fun, quick read - great beach book</Summary><Content>Good book by a great author (who happens to live a few miles from me!).

During a business negotiation, once you've &lt;br /&gt;won a point, drop it. Don't mention it again. I've already conceded that &lt;br /&gt;you could keep the initial hundred thousand."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* "You know from the day you start that it can't last forever," he said. "Even &lt;br /&gt;if you go all the way to the pros, it's short term. Thirty is old. Thirty-five is &lt;br /&gt;ancient. And that's if you escape serious injury. You're never more than &lt;br /&gt;one play away from the end of your career. Or even the end of your life. &lt;br /&gt;Each time the ball is snapped, it's a tempt of fate."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there was this tidbit of suspenseful writing:&lt;br /&gt;* Griff hadn't heard the approach of Speakman's chair and was startled &lt;br /&gt;to find him so close. Prison would do that to you, too. Make you jumpy. &lt;br /&gt;Linemen topping three hundred pounds used to charge at him bent on &lt;br /&gt;inflicting injury and pain, teeth bared behind their face guards, eyes &lt;br /&gt;slitted with malice. He'd been prepared for them and was conditioned &lt;br /&gt;to take their abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll like PLAY DIRTY and will have difficulty putting it down . . . also,&lt;br /&gt;it will leave you anxiously awaiting the publication of Brown's&lt;br /&gt;next book.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0743289358</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2F6N60Z96CAJI</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-01-10</Date><Summary>Like fine wine, Brown continues to improve in subtle ways</Summary><Content>Sandra Brown has created another superhero for those who love their mysteries flavored with romance. Griff Burkett, former Dallas Cowboy football icon, has just been released from prison after serving five years for racketeering. In a state where football is king, he was convicted of shaving points and conspiring with mobsters to cheat his fans of imminent victory. There is no way that he ever could serve enough time to redeem himself in the eyes of most Texans. Yet, upon his release, one of the state's wealthiest couples invites him to their estate and offers him a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As owners of the innovative and successful SunSouth Airlines, Foster and Laura Speakman are used to getting what they want, and they have the means to pay for it. The simple task that they require of Griff promises to pay him one-million dollars a year, and it's all perfectly legal. With everyone else turning their backs on him, the disgraced hero accepts their bizarre offer and steps into a dangerous world where nothing is as it seems and everyone plays dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Speakmans to his old coach and foster father, from Stanley Rodarte, a thug out to torment Griff in every possible way, to the Vista boys who facilitated his downfall, all have secrets and hidden agendas that serve to push Griff to the wall. He does not want to return to prison and is doing his best to follow the rules of his parole. Though debased in numerous ways by unforgiving former fans and disregarded by those who once sought his favor, Griff is determined to become a better person. He had time to do some soul searching while behind bars and recognizes that, despite his difficult childhood, he had been given the talent and opportunity to do more with his life. Regardless of how everyone else played, he is resolved to make the right choices and play fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the story unfolds, so do the complexities of Griff's deal with the Speakmans as he finds himself increasingly drawn to Laura Speakman. Though scorned by his public, Griff remains very much in the public eye, his every move scrutinized not only by the tabloids but also by Stanley Rodarte. He simply cannot afford to do anything stupid; his freedom depends on it. Those of us romantics who enjoy the genre have come to expect a happy ending, no matter how complicated and impossible the situations become. Our reward is that we get to watch a creative talent work out the details for us and make it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Sandra Brown moved from straight romance to mystery/romance, it has been difficult to find new ways to praise her books. Yet, like fine wine, she continues to improve in subtle ways. With PLAY DIRTY, I notice a definite change in how she uses dialogue not only to define her characters but also to add a delightful measure of humor so often missing in earlier works. I don't know what Brown will do for an encore after this sure-to-be bestseller, but I can be certain that it will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

But the disgraced Cowboys quarterback can never return to life as he knew it before he was caught cheating. In a place where football is practically a religion, Griff committed a cardinal sin, and no one is forgiving.&lt;P&gt;Foster Speakman, owner and CEO of SunSouth Airlines, and his wife, Laura, are a golden couple. Successful and wealthy, they lived a charmed life before fate cruelly intervened and denied them the one thing they wanted most -- a child. It's said that money can't buy everything. But it can buy a disgraced football player fresh out of prison and out of prospects.&lt;P&gt;The job Griff agrees to do for the Speakmans demands secrecy. But he soon finds himself once again in the spotlight of suspicion. An unsolved murder comes back to haunt him in the form of his nemesis, Stanley Rodarte, who has made Griff's destruction his life's mission. While safeguarding his new enterprise, Griff must also protect those around him, especially Laura Speakman, from Rodarte's ruthlessness. Griff stands to gain the highest payoff he could ever imagine, but cashing in on it will require him to forfeit his only chance for redemption...and love.&lt;P&gt;Griff is now playing a high-stakes game, and at the final whistle, one player will be dead.&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Play Dirty&lt;/i&gt; is Sandra Brown's wildest ride yet, with hairpin turns of plot all along the way.

riveting and meticulously researched account of the Colfax Massacre and its legal aftermath -- a real eye-opener.</Summary><Content>I'm an avid history buff and a pretty demanding critic, and I found "The Day Freedom Died" absolutely riveting.  I read it on vacation this week and couldn't put it down.  Charles Lane has basically unearthed a little-known event -- the brutal slaughter of many dozens of freedmen in Colfax, Louisiana, on or around Easter Sunday 1873, by former Confederates (now Klansmen) desperately seeking to hold back Reconstruction and to prevent blacks and radical Republican whites from gaining local power -- and made it come to life.  This achievement is a tribute both to Lane's meticulous and definitive primary-source research and his fast-moving journalistic storytelling.  His rendering of the shocking events of Easter Sunday 1873 itself was incredibly dramatic (also so sad).  Lane paints stunningly detailed, nuanced, and evocative portraits of the important players in the drama.  And he helpfully and clearly puts the events in Louisiana in the context of Reconstruction generally.  As a practicing lawyer, former prosecutor, and a fan of legal history, I particularly appreciated that Lane goes way beyond merely reconstructing the massacre itself to discuss its legal aftermath.  The second half of the book recounts the federal government's attempt to prosecute the Colfax killers, and how that attempt ultimately, tragically faltered at the Supreme Court, which rendered a decision that effectively gutted the statute aimed at empowering federal prosecutors to prosecute Klan killings.  Lane (the Washington Post's longtime Supreme Court correspondent) is uniquely positioned to render such analysis, and he does it beautifully.  There are wonderful portraits here of the trial lawyers and the Supreme Court Justices who were key to the Colfax decision, and also a thoughtful analysis of the pertinent constitutional law issues and the Court's resolution of them.  Although tackling a narrower slice of legal history, "The Day Freedom Died" reminded me throughout of Richard Kluger's phenomenal book, "Simple Justice."  If you are an American history buff and particularly if you are drawn to either Reconstruction or legal history, you'll love this book.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I'm a college friend of Charles Lane's.  But even if I were not, I would still "approve of this message"!</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0805083421</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>2</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A29Y0RIGIJVTON</CustomerId><TotalVotes>2</TotalVotes><Date>2008-03-07</Date><Summary>Thoroughly engrossing, impressively researched, and a story that demands to be told</Summary><Content>Chuck Lane's "The Day Freedom Died" is the best kind of popular history: thoroughly researched, well-written, and makes for a quick read. As the events of the Colfax Massacre shift from historical happenstance to a law-and-order whodunit to a legal case to a Supreme Court decision, Lane shifts tenses and tones effectively without losing the reader. He effectively conveys the mood of the times and the way that the story of the Colfax Massacre tied into the overall tenor of Reconstruction, and the injustice of its ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most disconcerting thing about the book is its language: Lane writes in modern language, but uses the words "Negro" and "colored" throughout the text in accordance with the usage of the times, as he writes in an author's note at the beginning. The choice is jarring for the first few pages, but defensible in the context of the story about the betrayal of Southern African-Americans by an alliance of Southern whites with Northern whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of the book tells you that what you're about to read ought to make you mad. The day that freedom died and Reconstruction was betrayed is one that should be remembered, and one that should engender outrage. Lane tells the story well and lets the facts speak for themselves. Which they do, loudly, long after the victims were silenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Full disclosure: Chuck Lane is a colleague and a friend.)</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><EditorialReviews><EditorialReview><Source>Product Description</Source><Content>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The untold story of the slaying of a Southern town&amp;#8217;s ex-slaves and a white lawyer&amp;#8217;s historic battle to bring the perpretators to justice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Following the Civil War, Colfax, Louisiana, was a town, like many, where African Americans and whites mingled uneasily. But on April 13, 1873, a small army of white ex&amp;#8211;Confederate soldiers, enraged after attempts by freedmen to assert their new rights, killed more than sixty African Americans who had occupied a courthouse. With skill and tenacity, &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8217;s Charles Lane transforms this nearly forgotten incident into a riveting historical saga.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seeking justice for the slain, one brave U.S. attorney, James Beckwith, risked his life and career to investigate and punish the perpetrators&amp;#8212;but they all went free. What followed was a series of courtroom dramas that culminated at the Supreme Court, where the justices&amp;#8217; verdict compromised the victories of the Civil War and left Southern blacks at the mercy of violent whites for generations. &lt;i&gt;The Day Freedom Died &lt;/i&gt;is an electrifying piece of historical detective work that captures a gallery of characters from presidents to townspeople, and re-creates the bloody days of Reconstruction, when the often brutal struggle for equality moved from the battlefield into communities across the nation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</Content></EditorialReview></EditorialReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0195310268</ASIN><Title>The Colfax Massacre: The Untold Story of Black Power, White Terror and the Death of Reconstruction</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0674026551</ASIN><Title>Lincoln and the Court</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0670018406</ASIN><Title>The Bloody Shirt: Terror After Appomattox</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0195323564</ASIN><Title>Aggressive Nationalism: McCulloch v.

The reader is introduced to this imaginary space during the first pages of chapter one. The boys' group, 'Chums of Chance,' discuss the altitude of their dirigible with the conclusion that if they keep going up into the lighted sky, they'll be going down. How can rising become falling? All of the key characters in the tale ask themselves similar questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reader realizes early on that the reading time of "Against the Day" will be different from other novels, longer and shorter. In the novel, the path of light is followed as it travels through the pages at a constant velocity. Yet it is always changing over time, illuminating evolving territories and imaginary borders, and shining on the people who are both grounded and accepting of fantasy. The reader's view of history and individual destiny is guided by Pynchon's description of a time-territory-personality matrix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major themes emerge from this imaginary time-space. One of them describes the human genius and folly as seen in the historical record. Pynchon shows the reader that ideas begin as fantasy. Mathematicians translate these fantasies into arbitrary symbols using an arcane logical system. Scientists use the symbols in their experiments attempting to ground them in quotidian reality. Leaders of commerce take the realized ideas and create marketable products. Politicians corner the markets and carve up the land for power and defense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel describes paths for the secondary characters parallel to the historical record, but different. Unlike history, the lives of many of the background characters do not flow continuously. Some stay as children in the world of fantasy. Some get bound up in symbols and never find the ground. Some characters are caught up in science without anticipating the applications that will be made of their discoveries. Other characters spend their lives in commerce fighting for wages or using tactics to maintain the dominance of wealth. The politicians look at the earth in terms of artificial geographic borders, defending their domains while encroaching on the property of others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary characters are anarchists of fantasy, mathematics, science, commerce, and politics. They challenge the frontiers in each of these dimensions. The reader comes to an understanding of the driving force and goal of anarchy through the conscious and unconscious choices the characters make. Readers then have choices. Do we stay as children in fantasy, or do we take on adult responsibility? Are we satisfied with a symbolic description of the world or do we live in it? Can we make a living by the economic rules but also free ourselves from materialism? Do we ascend to political power or resist borders that require defense and foster encroachment? Is there a Shambhala, a vanishing point on this earth where we can approach perfect, boundless, infinite, multi-dimensional peace? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your own personal odyssey as you read Against the Day. Experience the fantasy but go beyond it. Do the math but learn to apply limits. Explore science but prevent its use in evil applications. See how to earn a living but avoid the traps of being owned by your possessions. Become aware of political power and fight against the immoral if necessary. And above all, when down becomes up, explore the frontiers of your life looking for Shambhala.&lt;br /&gt;</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0143112562</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2S9JWI21VKITQ</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-01-21</Date><Summary>Pynchon Does It Again------!!!!!!!</Summary><Content>When Thomas Pynchon writes, everybody SHOULD listen~~!!!!!

Others have aptly spoken of its themes of the nature of light, generally, and in mathematics and physics, specifically, through its real and imaginary components, to help us understand where our philosophical theories are heading.  Pynchon's descriptions of inventions and things technical of the past are simply great, and he does not just fill his book with obscure facts of history, but his powers of pure prose are still quite extraordinary.  Against the Day is not an easy book to read.  It took me three or four months of concerted effort to finish.  I would highly recommend everyone to read the online wiki along with the book.  You will learn so many amazing things if you do.  I'm a somewhat slow reader anyway, as I like to savor and turn around what an author is saying, so it took me almost an hour to read every ten pages; then, I would spend another hour just going through the wiki.  Others have compared Against the Day to works of many authors.  I would just add the magical realism of One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  Every few pages, Marquez echoes the word "solitude" within the text.  Pynchon does something similar but with somewhat more complexity to combinations, permutations, synonyms, and antonyms of the title, "Against the Day."   </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0143112562</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1W6ZXY576TJZX</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2007-12-31</Date><Summary>Coming Home to Pynchon</Summary><Content>As a freshman in college, I was blown away by Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow(1973). His deft use of scientific lore and legend helped shape my interest in the history of science and technology. His connection to Cornell University -- he began as an engineer (similar to Kurt Vonnegut, who studied biochem, and was at Cornell a decade or two prior to Pynchon), discovered creative writing, and perhaps heard Henry Guerlac's lectures on the history of science -- also shaped my decision to take the PhD in the history of science from Cornell's L. Pearce Williams (a Guerlac student who, like Pynchon and Vonnegut, took some time off from college to serve in the US military).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my abiding love for Gravity's Rainbow and V., I was deeply disappointed by Pynchon's novel Vineland (1990). I turned to Cormac McCarthy and other (lessor) writers, and totally missed the publication of Pynchon's Mason &amp; Dixon (1997). It's at the top of my winter reading list, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against the Day is a great novel and embodies the very best of Pynchon's writing skills. The story is solidly grounded in historical details such as the labor struggles of the western mining camps, there are fantastic myths based on real phenomena such as the double refraction of Iceland spar, strong believable characters such as Dally Rideout and Kit Traverse work their way into your heart, and there is plenty of outrageous goofiness such as the crew (the Chums of Chance) manning a sci-fi version of a zeppelin (the Inconvenience). While there are also a lot of pesky loose ends that seem to get lost along the way, no one ever accused of Pynchon of writing in a tight Hemingwayesque style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fantastic literary device, the Chums of Chance are delightful. They get to use super sci-fi devices to transport through the center of the earth and to communicate with other times. Their Dickensonian names -- ranging from the youngest crew member, Darby Suckling, to the second in command, Lindsay Noseworth -- are a good clue of what this crew is all about. And, given that they self-referentially speak of a series of dime novels about their adventures, they are solidly out of the Cervantes Don Quixote tradition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love this novel for its focus on the optimistic, global labor movement of the late 19th/early 20 the century, and the way that optimism was dashed on the rocks of The Great War (WWI) and the emergence of international corporate control over society/economics/politics. Much of the action centers on the mining camps of the American West, and the brutal suppression of the movement by the Rockefeller or Carnegie-like Scarsdale Vibe. Although many of the characters spend time in Mexico or Europe, they are there as emigres from the American labor movement, and their actions draw out parallels to and connections with the Zapatistas and World Anarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the novel, many of the Western Federation of Miners ("Miners Union") struggles take place during the silver boom and in places such as Leadville and Telluride, Colorado (historically known as the "Colorado Labor Wars"). The struggles and the mythology, ranging from Joe Hill of the IWW "Wobblies" to the tommyknockers that haunted the underground, are common to the mining history of Butte, Montana. Butte gets a few mentions in the book--mainly as another mining camp where union activists and company thugs (Pinkertons, etc) have met. And of course, the WFM was founded in Butte in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pynchon readers will like this book, as will all those who have the patience for an 1100 page novel, the wit to follow the twists and turns of several interwoven plots, and a keen appreciation for fine American literature.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0143112562</ASIN><Rating>4</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>AA4PBJYRGCI5C</CustomerId><TotalVotes>2</TotalVotes><Date>2007-12-29</Date><Summary>Did I really spend 9 months reading this?</Summary><Content>Maddeningly long, disjointed and chaotic, this book is still interesting for its wonderful prose and interesting ideas.

The plot is brilliant. Beautiful news anchor Constance Young leaves Key News for a competitor. On the night of her debut at the morning news show, she is found dead at the bottom of her swimming pool. Not far from the pool also a huge dog is found dead at approximately the same time. Constance is a keen swimmer, so what happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fast paced easy read, with short chapters, not dwelling on unnecessary details. The characters are complex and interesting. (And no, it's not easy to guess who did it!) That the author works in television, is apparent from her detailed knowledge of this world. Add to this her obvious knack for writing page-turners, and her success as a bestselling author is no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After "When Day Breaks" I bought the rest of her books and have enjoyed them all just as much.

There is "KEY to America," a morning show, and "KEY Evening Headlines," a nightly news show just for starters and the competition is fierce.  The events happen over a week's time span in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story opens in a Manhattan animal shelter where an unknown person is intent on getting a dog, a large dog that is roughly 112 pounds.  The attendant there convinces the stranger to take a Great Dane named Marco who was  well-trained by his previous owner who had to move and couldn't take him with him.  The new owner takes the dog far out in the country to Constance Young's get-away country home and convinces the dog to play fetch with a rubber ball and, as the dog gets muddy, throws a ball in the pool so the dog follows it.  As Marco is swimming in the pool he sees something big and shiny thrown in the pool by his new owner.  It is a toaster connected by an orange outdoor cord and the dog dies.  This is a very scary prologue to the mystery and murder that is about to start and gives us insight into the murderer's character.  This killer not only hates enough to kill a lovely dog that never hurt anyone but is also ready to take a human being's life, as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constance Young took over the show "KEY to America" after Eliza Blake went to anchor "KEY Evening Headlines."  Constance became the "undisputed star of morning television" and was now quitting "KEY to America" and moving to the competition.  At KEY News, co-workers and bosses alike have mixed feelings about Constance's new job as it either makes their job easier or much harder.  Her replacement at "KEY to America" is going to be a young woman who is friend/lover to the producer.  Constance enjoys her farewell show and luncheon and heads to her country house to relax before taking her new job.  The next morning, Constance is found by her housekeeper; drowned in her pool.  While it looks like an accident at first, the coroner and other evidence found by police soon lead to the conclusion that she was murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Eliza Blake and her friends at KEY begin to investigate the murder on their own, the suspect list gets longer and longer and the danger to Eliza and her friends come closer and closer to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of great plot twists and turns, this is a suspenseful and enjoyable read.

But her plans to move herself and her loyal audience to another network were cancelled when she ended up at the bottom of her swimming pool. And the fabled unicorn amulet that Constance had been wearing during her final hours&amp;#8212;a gift from King Arthur to his beloved Guinevere and the centerpiece of the upcoming Camelot exhibit at New York's Cloisters museum&amp;#8212;is missing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A morning show veteran and now anchor of the &lt;I&gt;KEY Evening Headlines,&lt;/I&gt; Eliza Blake is shocked by the death of her former colleague, and is determined to discover who wanted Constance out of the way . . . and why. To do so, she enlists the aid of three KEY News coworkers: "Jane-of-all-trades" Annabelle Murphy, who can switch from producing to sleuthing at a moment's notice; charming and fearless cameraman extraordinaire B.J. D'Elia to add brains, brawn, and a much-needed male perspective to the team; and Dr. Margo Gonzalez, on-air psychiatrist, who understands the complex puzzles of the human mind. Calling themselves "The Sunrise Suspense Society," they set out to get to the bottom of the heinous murder, in a case that will test their ingenuity and their courage to the very limits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The deeper they dig, the more twisted the trail to Constance's killer becomes&amp;#8212;as the list of suspects grows longer by the minute. Was it her spurned and enraged medievalist lover, or a muckraking author who blamed her for ruining her life? Perhaps money was the motive, and Constance's sister, jealous of her wealth and fame, was responsible. Or possibly someone at Key News was angry enough&amp;#8212;or frightened enough&amp;#8212;to commit cold-blooded murder. The one sure thing is that Constance Young made a lot of enemies&amp;#8212;and now one of them is Eliza's enemy as well. And the closer she and the Society get to unmasking the murderer, the closer they each get to dying, suddenly . . . and brutally. &lt;/p&gt;</Content></EditorialReview></EditorialReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>1416523375</ASIN><Title>Laced (Regan Reilly Mysteries, No. 10)</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0061286095</ASIN><Title>It Only Takes a Moment: A Novel of Suspense</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>B000JSDPSC</ASIN><Title>Lights Out Tonight</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0312977433</ASIN><Title>Let Me Whisper in Your Ear</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0312969244</ASIN><Title>Do You Want to Know a Secret?: A Novel</Title></SimilarProduct></SimilarProducts><BrowseNodes><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>10485</BrowseNodeId><Name>Mystery &amp;

Although the author indulged in a bit too much moralizing for my taste, he still manages to deliver a highly detailed and informative account of the Munich massacre and it's aftermath. He does a good job at weaving the lives and personalities of the victims-as well as the perpetrators-with a blow by blow narrative of both the massacre and the Israeli retaliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the Israelis had serious reservations about coming back to the country where so many of their people-including immediate family members for some-were killed. Despite this, they came to Munich enthusiastic to compete and represent their country. Ironically, their fears turned out to be legitimate, only not for the reason they suspected. The fact that Jews were being killed in Germany yet again was not the only tragic irony of the Munich Olympics massacre. There was also the fact that the German officials had purposely scaled back security at the events precisely because of the nation's history. They were desperately trying to redeem their nation's reputation and they were afraid that excessive security would evoke painful memories of the Third Reich. This decision had devastating consequences. Reeve pulls no punches in his criticism of the Germans. By most accounts-and Reeve is sure to emphasize the point-the rescue attempt that resulted in the death of all of the athletes was completely botched by the Germans. They come off as looking completely incompetent and Reeve does not shy away from pointing this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeve then goes on to Israel's retaliation which was code-named, the "Wrath of God" operation. This is where the Israelis hunted down and assasinated dozens of people who were thought to be involved in the Munich attack. Anyone who has seen Stephen Spielberg's film 'Munich' will recognize the names and locations of these asassinations. As I stated previously, Reeve tends to over-moralize the issue by constantly sticking his two cents in about the massacre itself, Israel's response, and terorism in general. It's not that I necessarily disagree with him, but I just don't feel the need to be preached to about right and wrong. Other than that, it is well worth the read. </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>1559708131</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>2</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A133ZC2Z8MAIED</CustomerId><TotalVotes>2</TotalVotes><Date>2006-08-15</Date><Summary>The death of the 1972 Munich Olympics.</Summary><Content>This is an exceptional read on the killing of Israeli athletes in the 1972 Munich Olympics.  These were defenseless individuals, not even properly guarded by the German authorities.  The Palestinian Fatah movement commissioned Black September to take as many of the team hostage so they could force the release of over two hundred other hardened killers.  The Israeli authorities would not do this.  Therefore the Germans came up with a ridiculously simple plan to free the nine Israeli athletes and kill the hostage takers.  They made so many simple mistakes, that even some policemen refused to take part in it.  When the Palestinians and hostages arrived at the airport, an hour long shoot out resulted with five Palestinians killed and all nine athletes killed.  This really destroyed the innocence of the Olympic Games and showed really what the Palestian Fatah were really all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book also covers the revenge killings by Israel.  The author disagrees that these have a beneficial effect on the outcome of the battle.  I disagree.  These revenge killings show that the hunter can become the hunted.  It puts the fear into those that cause devastation throughout the world.  Other than that, I think this is a fine read.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>1559708131</ASIN><Rating>2</Rating><HelpfulVotes>10</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2K8881SE9Y538</CustomerId><TotalVotes>22</TotalVotes><Date>2006-01-08</Date><Summary>View From the Left</Summary><Content>What a surprise, another hand wringing liberal condemnation of Israel's defense and foreign policy. Reeve's account is a detailed look at the events in Munich, and a somewhat less detailed look at subsequent events.  To call it non-fiction is a stretch, as there are many holes to plug, and Reeve chooses to plug them with an ill-disquised comfort for chatting with terrorists, and sharing his clearly Eurocentric liberal view of the mideast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He takes one short swipe at the notion that he is equating the Israeli response with the initial murders of the Jewish athletes, but spends the entire rest of his effort doing just that.  His ultimate editorial view seems to be that -- even after the murders of two athletes in cold blood in the Olympic village -- if the Germans hadn't so profoundly botched their "rescue" attempt, everyone else would be alive today.  I came away with the distinct impression that he has more contempt for the German effort and the Olympic Committees than with the terrorists themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, worth the read, but we could have done without learning Reeve's political viewpoints, and his Miss America dreams for "world peace."</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>1559708131</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>10</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2LO0I66C75QZI</CustomerId><TotalVotes>25</TotalVotes><Date>2005-12-31</Date><Summary>"Debunk "Munich" with this book</Summary><Content>AS you probably know, the elitists in hollywood would like you to sympathize with terrorists so we can understand them and coddle them with empathy.

Their target was the temporary home of the Israeli Olympic team. Within 24 hours, 11 Israelis, five terrorists, and a German policeman were dead.&lt;p&gt;  Based largely on exhaustive investigation for the Oscar-winning documentary, &lt;I&gt;One Day in September&lt;/I&gt; is the definitive account of the tragedy. Simon Reeve has gathered extraordinary information from a number of sources, including recently released Stasi files and interviews with key figures, including the families of the hostages, politicians, policemen, advisors, fellow athletes, media figures, and even the lone surviving member of the group that carried out the attack. Reeve's control over his material is admirable. He vividly paints images of the individuals involved, humanizing a narrative that cracks and buzzes with the compact tension of those 24 hours. At the same time, he provides the background to the attack, filling in vital historical context from the distant and recent past, such as the Arab-Jewish dispute that produced this and other terrorist actions and their responses.&lt;p&gt;  Reeve conveys the public horror of Jews being incarcerated on German soil, which led the German authorities to make crucial judgments, with tragic results. Fatal errors were made that can only be fully understood through the underlying dynamics of not only Middle East history, but also postwar European politics, individual and institutional arrogance, inexperience, and political pressure--including from the International Olympic Committee. Reeve follows up the events of that day by exposing the full extent of the Israeli revenge mission, which over the next 20 years hunted down and killed those responsible for the attack. He has not only written a compelling book, but provided a considerable service in allowing readers to understand the forces of hatred and history that conspired toward inevitable, but no less tragic human consequences.&lt;p&gt;  Those who were a part of the huge live media audience that watched helplessly as events unfolded will undoubtedly experience again the sense of dread at recalling those traumatized, shackled figures led out from the Olympic Village to their fate on a German airfield. Those who make the mistake of thinking the dark days of international terrorism are history will read &lt;I&gt;One Day in September&lt;/I&gt; and remember that the same underlying tensions still cast shadows over our present and our future. &lt;I&gt;--Fiona Buckland, Amazon.co.uk&lt;/I&gt; </Content></EditorialReview><EditorialReview><Source>Book Description</Source><Content>Published to coincide

I just got this third book when I checked the section of new  crime stories in W.H. Smith in Paris, and I do not regret getting it and reading it. I guess from now on I am going to read his books for himself and I will probably call him Christopher to separate him from his mother. This book is in many ways a page turner, but I don't think that's its main characteristic nor quality. For me the main character is that it is entirely contained in one world, West Hollywood centered on the gay community there. After a few chapters you are surprised by the fact that it sounds natural, normal, banal, in other words just plain simple. The psychology, the behavior, the culture, in one word the personalities of Christopher's characters are welcoming you with a wink and a smile. You feel loved, wanted in this world, trusted as a friend. That feeling of being the friendly and nonchalant voyeur in this neighborhood puts you at ease and you just let yourself relax and enter the slit in the fabric that enables you to witness the events of this world. And what events! What fascinating events! It is a thriller, so there are crimes, but instead of feeling or even thinking that it is no surprise that these "fags" could commit such horrible crimes, you feel and think they are committing these crimes either because they are pedophiles which has nothing to do with being gay, or because they have suffered unbearable violence in their youth and gotten no help to negotiate a proper answer to it that could lead them to some peace with themselves, distance with the monster that exploited them, or because they are sick in a way or another, sick with drugs, sick with alcohol, sick with greed, and probably sick with psychological distortion, dismemberment, warping or other disturbances. You project yourself totally into the characters that are running after the criminals, be they men or women, gay or straight. It does not matter anymore. Christopher has erased the problem. Yet we must say that he takes us so deep into horror that it could be classified as some kind of horror literature though he does not want to lead us down that road and is very careful to avoid the gritty details that would make him jump over the limit. The other characteristic that is interesting is the way he follows the trail of the criminals as a journalist and not as a cop. And Christopher adds one element that even makes it more effective: the hunter or tracker if your prefer is the hunted or tracked animal too. Right to the end of the novel, the crime-hunter Adam will be the prey or at least the tracked prey and all his reasoning to determine which way to go is in fact systematically the best way to keep the criminal bird of prey on his tracks. It is not that Adam is dumb. It is because when you only know part of the truth and you try to reconstruct the whole truth in order to be ahead of the criminal you are tracking, you cannot get to the right conclusion, you may but there is never any necessity that it be true because there are always several points of view to take into account and when you are following a trail you have to choose between the low road or the high road or the middle road since you can't follow more than one at a time. So the end is also the result of some luck in a way. But it can't be avoided because Adam, due to his name, cannot be God, hence cannot be true all the time. When you close the book, you think it over and try to sum it up in one sentence and you find it very difficult. The American society, Los Angeles or California if you prefer, is leading crime to some extreme points that always amaze me and the answer to this violence and crime is too often in the hands of simple citizens either because civil society does not trust the police or because the police is far from answering at the proper level of efficiency, motivation and means. Not enough cops, conflicting police bodies and institutions, lack of interest and even at times plain bigotry against some types of victims. Is gay bashing still a legitimate sport or not? We definitely have this question in the back of our minds when we close the book. And nothing would have been possible if at least three women had not helped very effectively, and that's maybe why the book seems to be balanced and full of sanity. It is not sexually segregative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines&lt;br /&gt;</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>1401359892</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A3396VTRHLNJW7</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2007-11-17</Date><Summary>simply amazing</Summary><Content>This book is my new favorite book. At first, I was just reading it for something to do, but soon after starting it I was enthralled by what I was reading. The complexity and depth of this novel is what is truly astounding. Almost everything you think you know about what is happening is unraveled by the end, when Rice pulls out all the stops. This book is one of the best I have ever read, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I haven't read the other two books by Christopher Rice, but if this book is anything to go by, I'm getting them tomorrow. By the end of the book, every minor plot line and every intricate detail are revealed to have grave importance, and nothing is as it seems. It's thrilling and suspenseful, and all around a great read. Everyone should read it.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>1401359892</ASIN><Rating>2</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A3KTSZY0MIY27X</CustomerId><TotalVotes>0</TotalVotes><Date>2007-11-07</Date><Summary>Disappointed</Summary><Content>Was really looking forward to this book but it didn't hold up.

He soon learns his former lover has disappeared, but what hes about to uncover is far more diabolical than he could ever have imagined.

Editors Mark Coté, Richard J.F. Day, and Greig de Peuter, along with a number of innovative voices from a variety of different academic fields and political movements, examine three key themes: the university as a contested institution, the role of the politically engaged intellectual, and experiments in alternative education. The collection contributes to the debates on the neoliberal transformation of higher education, and to the diffusion of social movements that insist it is possible to create workable alternatives to the current world order.&lt;P&gt;This critical examination of the educational dimension of social and political struggles is presented by both professional academics and activists, many of whom are directly involved in the very experiments they discuss. Rescuing and revaluing the concept of utopia, the editors and their international contributors propose that utopian theory and practice acquire a new relevance in light of the hyper-inclusive logic of neoliberalism.  &lt;i&gt;Utopian Pedagogy&lt;/i&gt; is a challenge to the developing world order that will stimulate debate in the fields of education and beyond, and encourage the development of socially sustainable alternatives.&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contributors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Albert&lt;br&gt;Brian Alleyne&lt;br&gt;Ian Angus&lt;br&gt;Allan Antliff&lt;br&gt;Franco Berardi&lt;br&gt;MarkEdelman Boren&lt;br&gt;Guido Borio&lt;br&gt;Edna Brophy&lt;br&gt;Colectivo Situaciones&lt;br&gt;Mark Coté&lt;br&gt;Mariarosa DallaCosta&lt;br&gt;Richard J.F.

Description</Source><Content>America after the Civil War was a land of shattered promises and entrenched hatreds. In the explosive South, danger took many forms: white extremists loyal to a defeated world terrorized former slaves, while in the halls of government, bitter and byzantine political warfare raged between Republicans and Democrats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In The Day Freedom Died, Charles Lane draws us vividly into this war-torn world with a true story whose larger dimensions have never been fully explored. Here is the epic tale of the Colfax Massacre, the mass murder of more than sixty black men on Easter Sunday 1873 that propelled a small Louisiana town into the center of the nations consciousness. As the smoke cleared, the perpetrators created a falsified version of events to justify their crimes. But a tenacious Northern-born lawyer rejected the lies. Convinced that the Colfax murderers must be punished lest the suffering of the Civil War be in vain, U.S. Attorney James Beckwith of New Orleans pursued the killers despite death threats and bureaucratic intrigue - until the final showdown at the Supreme Court of the United States. The ruling that decided the case influenced race relations in the United States for decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An electrifying piece of historical detective work, The Day Freedom Died brings to life a gallery of memorable characters in addition to Beckwith: Willie Calhoun, the iconoclastic Southerner who dreamed of building a bastion of equal rights on his Louisiana plantation; Christopher Columbus Nash, the white supremacist avenger who organized the Colfax Massacre; William Ward, the black Union Army veteran who took up arms against white terrorists; Ulysses S. Grant, the well-intentioned but beleaguered president; and Joseph P. Bradley, the brilliant justice of the Supreme Court whose political and legal calculations would shape the dramas troubling final act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles Lane captures every exciting element of this electrifying saga, from the horror at Colfax, to the political battles that threatened the Grant presidency, to the dramatic courtroom battles that changed history. The Day Freedom Died is a gripping account of the events that gave the Civil War a monumental final chapter and an era in which the often brutal struggle for equality moved from battlefields into communities across the nation.</Content></EditorialReview></EditorialReviews><BrowseNodes><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>4859</BrowseNodeId><Name>Reconstruction</Name><Ancestors><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>4854</BrowseNodeId><Name>19th

to the Saga, but not as good as the first.</Summary><Content>This review is for book 2 only, not for the all four books like alot of the other reviews out there.  This is the second book in The War Against the Chtorr series and we find our hero Jim Mcarthy and Duke leading a squad of bug killing marines until they get called away on a special mission.  To make a long story short, there is a helicopter crash, a critical death, and a new Chtorran species discovered.  Based on events in the book Jim finds himself believing that humans and the giant worms called chtorrs could live on earth in a peacful harmony.  Can we?, or are we destined down the path of unavoidable war?  You will have to read to find out!  The book only gets four stars because there are spans of the book that get very boring and the action has decreased alot in this book.  I would say this book is for story and building and to go into more detail of the vastness and the advancment of the Chtorran ecology over ours.  I realy enjoyed the book except for those 2 or 3 spans I had trouble keeping my eyes open during.  I haven't read the third book yet but the ending of this book has me pining to get the third.  It isn't easy to find localy and on amazon it seems a little pricey for such and old book but maybe that's because they are so hard to get a hold of. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read A Matter for Men, like I need to, if you read A Matter for Men you are probably just as anxious to read this as I am to read A Rage for Revenge!!</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0553277650</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>2</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1TRGEGP4T7JZ4</CustomerId><TotalVotes>2</TotalVotes><Date>2005-09-21</Date><Summary>Buy This Book and then Hang On- The Wait is Almost Over</Summary><Content>Kill whomever you have to, but read this series. If you are in the joint, make sure that the prison library has this one in stock. If you have to take five books on a desert island, let this series be books one through four, with the Boy Scout manual or the bible (your preference, faith or survival) being number five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first read this series, I was still living at home with my parents. My mother got it for me because I was laid up off of work from a fall compounded with electrical burns from a 12,000 volt line (I used to be an electrician...it wasn't that injury that caused me to leave). Knowing my love for good SF and SF series, and seeing the "creepy-bug-worm-things" on the cover, she picked it up, hoping the series would help keep my mind off of my injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked...quite well, in fact. I was so engrossed in the books that I finished them all in a span of 3 1/2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily some of the best post-modern SF that I have ever read. Sicker yet, Gerrold's future is starting to look a lot like our own present...anyone seen any creepy worms yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the waiting began....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have news!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just visited Gerrold's site, as of July 4th of 2004, he had more than 250,000 words done on book five: "A Method for Madness." However, upon telling the publishers that it would break 300K, he was told to split it up, so we're looking at 166K words on book five, not counting sideline stuff, 66K into book six, and it seems that he'll be finishing it relatively soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has sample chapters available on his website, www.gerrold.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, rejoice...the time of deliverance is almost at hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm guessing that book five will hit the shelves sometime next year...then again, I haven't searched Amazon...there may be more updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about that desert island...if book five hits, say goodbye to the bible or the boy scout manual, or sneak 'em in your daypack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're that damn good.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0553277650</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>8</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>AV1YU7SUT7ZO8</CustomerId><TotalVotes>17</TotalVotes><Date>2002-09-25</Date><Summary>Gerrold Betrays Readers</Summary><Content>The first 4 books of this series are one of the greatest achievements in Sci-Fi literature.  That also makes it one of the greatest betrayals ever perpetrated by an author upon his readers.  I don't know what the deal is, greed, illness, a lobotomy, but books 5 (A Method for Madness) &amp; 6 (A Time for Treason) don't look like they will ever see daylight.  I found the author's site where there is mention of a movie based on the series but I don't think it's going anywhere and he wouldn't reply to email.&lt;p&gt;There is a special place in **** reserved for authors of unfinished series, David Gerrold claimed his with this one.  I recommend against reading this, it's too painful to stop so abruptly.  An incredible tragedy.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0553277650</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>3</HelpfulVotes><TotalVotes>5</TotalVotes><Date>2000-06-22</Date><Summary>Wonderful Science Fiction</Summary><Content>Th ewar against the chtorr is a post apocaliptic setting that immediately grabs your attention.

At a later point, the incomplete series was rereleased with a few changes.  I first read the first three novels in a single hardback  collection that I borrowed from a friend's house, and loved it. At the  time, I was unaware that David Gerrold had also written &quot;the Trouble  with Tribbles.&quot; This set has been with me through multiple moves, and  is the last book I will read this millenium. This series has not become  dated--in fact, many of the thoughts remain refreshingly new. David has  created a very complete world that is easy to enjoy. The characterizations  are complex, the plot engaging, and along with the intense descriptions  combine to present a seamless experience.  However, the series remains  unfinished, so ultimately, you must resolve the fate of the world yourself.</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0553278444</ASIN><Title>A Rage for Revenge (War Against the Chtorr, Book 3)</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0553277820</ASIN><Title>A Matter For Men (The War Against the Chtorr, Book 1)</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0553289764</ASIN><Title>SEASON FOR SLAUGHTER (The War Against the Chtorr, Book 4)</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>1932100113</ASIN><Title>Blood and Fire</Title></SimilarProduct><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0553264656</ASIN><Title>When Harlie Was One</Title></SimilarProduct></SimilarProducts><BrowseNodes><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>15232</BrowseNodeId><Name>Gerrold, David</Name><Ancestors><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>15211</BrowseNodeId><Name>( G )</Name><Ancestors><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>14652</BrowseNodeId><Name>Authors, A-Z</Name><Ancestors><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>25</BrowseNodeId><Name>Science Fiction &amp;

A young woman attempted to kill dozens of innocent people by poison, arson, and gunfire. Laurie Dann was her last victim. There were copycat crimes at other schools in other areas. This book has an index and photographs, but no maps or table of contents.. One effect was the passage of a village law banning handguns in this affluent community where alcoholism was widespread and marriages were stressed (Chapter27). [Was this law enforced or just on paper?] Many children were raised by maids or babysitters. In the future schools would keep doors locked and monitor visitors. The question of safety still remains. Are there any safe places in life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 1 asks a scary question: what if you hired a murderer as a baby-sitter? Laurie was good with children, but she had a life that was a mess. Chapter 2 recreates the events of that day. There is danger in a basement that has only one exit. Chapter 4 tells about Winnetka, a very unusual place. It is the home and refuge of the upper class and its problems (p.48). There was a high teenage suicide rate in this paradise (p.49). The following chapters seem to provide every detail that was known that day. There were incidents in Laurie Dann's life that were overlooked (Chapter 10). The police considered Laurie a suicide risk (Chapter 11). Laurie passed a lie-detector test (p.119). Laurie had other problems (Chapter 12). The people of Winnetka reacted to the journalists (p.189).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some padding in this book (Chapter 19). Laurie's friends knew of her sickness (p.207). Rich parents worked all hours to stay rich, poor parents did the same to survive (Chapter 21). Children became estranged from parents at younger ages. [Television?] People who knew Laurie's parents seemed to disappear after the event (Chapter 25). What could have happened if the regular teacher was there (p.256)? Laurie's attacks on people was widespread (p.259). Chapter 26 tells of Laurie's strange behavior in the last year of her life. The police learned of the drugs Laurie was taking (p.279); did they interact? Page 280 tells of the trick used against Laurie's relative by marriage. This story was used to terrify people (p.281). Polygraphs aren't reliable (p.283). [No scientific basis?] If parents spend little time with their children was this the fault of corporations (p.286)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one question that this book can't answer. Why has this crime been censored from the corporate media? School shootings never occurred before the 1968 Gun Control Act banned children from owning and using guns. Has Gun Prohibition alone caused school shootings? Guns became taboo items and fascinated teenagers. Or is it the economic oppression that continued with Nixon's devaluation of the dollar with the falling real wages of working people? This caused both parents to work outside the home.&lt;br /&gt;</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0688090850</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2I1BZGK92F7JY</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2006-08-09</Date><Summary>The people of Winnetka came off like clueless snobs</Summary><Content>I felt sorry for the children who were shot and the people Laurie Dann victimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the people of Winnetka really made me angry with their feelings of superiority, their demands, their wanting to have their way in all things, their hurry to sweep the tragedy under the rug, the way they refused to believe that "one of their own" could have perpetrated the crime, how they think money can insulate them from the real world, their 1950s attitudes towards women....I could go on for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was Laurie's father, Norman Wasserman - an enabler par excellence.  Laurie ex-husband came off as an arrogant spoiled brat as well but, contrary to Mr. Wasserman's claims, Russell Dann did not cause Laurie's mental problems.  She had those for years.  Everyone just chose to ignore them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well-written book which should be required reading for rich folks who think "it can't happen HERE."</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0688090850</ASIN><Rating>3</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>1999-10-08</Date><Summary>It was very interesting and accurate.</Summary><Content>I thought the book was very accurate and interesting.

Once I picked up this book and saw the last known photo of her it came back to me. This is an unfolding story. The big question that this books tries to answer for me is 'Why did she do it?'.Or better yet 'What led her to such a state of mind?'. It is difficult in a case like this to be able to answer these questions completely. But 'Day of Fury' tries to answer them from all different angles. I've read another book on this tradegy called 'Murder of Innocence', and I think this book by Joyce Egginton takes the high road and also goes more into depth with the aftermath. I like both books, but 'Day of Fury' seems to have more colors; painted by a seasoned writer in Egginton. &lt;p&gt;My header 'It could happen to YOU!' simply means that you just never know what can happen to you after a relationship goes sour. With Laurie Dann, was it just a marriage gone bad? Is this a commentary!  on OCD(Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder)? COULD this happen to YOU?&lt;p&gt;Great book! Need another one on this tragedy.</Content></Review></CustomerReviews><SimilarProducts><SimilarProduct><ASIN>0446515728</ASIN><Title>Murder of Innocence: The Tragic Life and Final Rampage of Laurie Dann</Title></SimilarProduct></SimilarProducts><BrowseNodes><BrowseNode><BrowseNodeId>2</BrowseNodeId><Name>Biographies &amp;
