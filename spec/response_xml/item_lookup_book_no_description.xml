The reader is introduced to this imaginary space during the first pages of chapter one. The boys' group, 'Chums of Chance,' discuss the altitude of their dirigible with the conclusion that if they keep going up into the lighted sky, they'll be going down. How can rising become falling? All of the key characters in the tale ask themselves similar questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reader realizes early on that the reading time of "Against the Day" will be different from other novels, longer and shorter. In the novel, the path of light is followed as it travels through the pages at a constant velocity. Yet it is always changing over time, illuminating evolving territories and imaginary borders, and shining on the people who are both grounded and accepting of fantasy. The reader's view of history and individual destiny is guided by Pynchon's description of a time-territory-personality matrix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major themes emerge from this imaginary time-space. One of them describes the human genius and folly as seen in the historical record. Pynchon shows the reader that ideas begin as fantasy. Mathematicians translate these fantasies into arbitrary symbols using an arcane logical system. Scientists use the symbols in their experiments attempting to ground them in quotidian reality. Leaders of commerce take the realized ideas and create marketable products. Politicians corner the markets and carve up the land for power and defense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel describes paths for the secondary characters parallel to the historical record, but different. Unlike history, the lives of many of the background characters do not flow continuously. Some stay as children in the world of fantasy. Some get bound up in symbols and never find the ground. Some characters are caught up in science without anticipating the applications that will be made of their discoveries. Other characters spend their lives in commerce fighting for wages or using tactics to maintain the dominance of wealth. The politicians look at the earth in terms of artificial geographic borders, defending their domains while encroaching on the property of others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary characters are anarchists of fantasy, mathematics, science, commerce, and politics. They challenge the frontiers in each of these dimensions. The reader comes to an understanding of the driving force and goal of anarchy through the conscious and unconscious choices the characters make. Readers then have choices. Do we stay as children in fantasy, or do we take on adult responsibility? Are we satisfied with a symbolic description of the world or do we live in it? Can we make a living by the economic rules but also free ourselves from materialism? Do we ascend to political power or resist borders that require defense and foster encroachment? Is there a Shambhala, a vanishing point on this earth where we can approach perfect, boundless, infinite, multi-dimensional peace? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your own personal odyssey as you read Against the Day. Experience the fantasy but go beyond it. Do the math but learn to apply limits. Explore science but prevent its use in evil applications. See how to earn a living but avoid the traps of being owned by your possessions. Become aware of political power and fight against the immoral if necessary. And above all, when down becomes up, explore the frontiers of your life looking for Shambhala.&lt;br /&gt;</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0143112562</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A2S9JWI21VKITQ</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2008-01-21</Date><Summary>Pynchon Does It Again------!!!!!!!</Summary><Content>When Thomas Pynchon writes, everybody SHOULD listen~~!!!!!

Others have aptly spoken of its themes of the nature of light, generally, and in mathematics and physics, specifically, through its real and imaginary components, to help us understand where our philosophical theories are heading.  Pynchon's descriptions of inventions and things technical of the past are simply great, and he does not just fill his book with obscure facts of history, but his powers of pure prose are still quite extraordinary.  Against the Day is not an easy book to read.  It took me three or four months of concerted effort to finish.  I would highly recommend everyone to read the online wiki along with the book.  You will learn so many amazing things if you do.  I'm a somewhat slow reader anyway, as I like to savor and turn around what an author is saying, so it took me almost an hour to read every ten pages; then, I would spend another hour just going through the wiki.  Others have compared Against the Day to works of many authors.  I would just add the magical realism of One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  Every few pages, Marquez echoes the word "solitude" within the text.  Pynchon does something similar but with somewhat more complexity to combinations, permutations, synonyms, and antonyms of the title, "Against the Day."   </Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0143112562</ASIN><Rating>5</Rating><HelpfulVotes>1</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>A1W6ZXY576TJZX</CustomerId><TotalVotes>1</TotalVotes><Date>2007-12-31</Date><Summary>Coming Home to Pynchon</Summary><Content>As a freshman in college, I was blown away by Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow(1973). His deft use of scientific lore and legend helped shape my interest in the history of science and technology. His connection to Cornell University -- he began as an engineer (similar to Kurt Vonnegut, who studied biochem, and was at Cornell a decade or two prior to Pynchon), discovered creative writing, and perhaps heard Henry Guerlac's lectures on the history of science -- also shaped my decision to take the PhD in the history of science from Cornell's L. Pearce Williams (a Guerlac student who, like Pynchon and Vonnegut, took some time off from college to serve in the US military).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my abiding love for Gravity's Rainbow and V., I was deeply disappointed by Pynchon's novel Vineland (1990). I turned to Cormac McCarthy and other (lessor) writers, and totally missed the publication of Pynchon's Mason &amp; Dixon (1997). It's at the top of my winter reading list, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against the Day is a great novel and embodies the very best of Pynchon's writing skills. The story is solidly grounded in historical details such as the labor struggles of the western mining camps, there are fantastic myths based on real phenomena such as the double refraction of Iceland spar, strong believable characters such as Dally Rideout and Kit Traverse work their way into your heart, and there is plenty of outrageous goofiness such as the crew (the Chums of Chance) manning a sci-fi version of a zeppelin (the Inconvenience). While there are also a lot of pesky loose ends that seem to get lost along the way, no one ever accused of Pynchon of writing in a tight Hemingwayesque style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fantastic literary device, the Chums of Chance are delightful. They get to use super sci-fi devices to transport through the center of the earth and to communicate with other times. Their Dickensonian names -- ranging from the youngest crew member, Darby Suckling, to the second in command, Lindsay Noseworth -- are a good clue of what this crew is all about. And, given that they self-referentially speak of a series of dime novels about their adventures, they are solidly out of the Cervantes Don Quixote tradition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love this novel for its focus on the optimistic, global labor movement of the late 19th/early 20 the century, and the way that optimism was dashed on the rocks of The Great War (WWI) and the emergence of international corporate control over society/economics/politics. Much of the action centers on the mining camps of the American West, and the brutal suppression of the movement by the Rockefeller or Carnegie-like Scarsdale Vibe. Although many of the characters spend time in Mexico or Europe, they are there as emigres from the American labor movement, and their actions draw out parallels to and connections with the Zapatistas and World Anarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the novel, many of the Western Federation of Miners ("Miners Union") struggles take place during the silver boom and in places such as Leadville and Telluride, Colorado (historically known as the "Colorado Labor Wars"). The struggles and the mythology, ranging from Joe Hill of the IWW "Wobblies" to the tommyknockers that haunted the underground, are common to the mining history of Butte, Montana. Butte gets a few mentions in the book--mainly as another mining camp where union activists and company thugs (Pinkertons, etc) have met. And of course, the WFM was founded in Butte in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pynchon readers will like this book, as will all those who have the patience for an 1100 page novel, the wit to follow the twists and turns of several interwoven plots, and a keen appreciation for fine American literature.</Content></Review><Review><ASIN>0143112562</ASIN><Rating>4</Rating><HelpfulVotes>0</HelpfulVotes><CustomerId>AA4PBJYRGCI5C</CustomerId><TotalVotes>2</TotalVotes><Date>2007-12-29</Date><Summary>Did I really spend 9 months reading this?</Summary><Content>Maddeningly long, disjointed and chaotic, this book is still interesting for its wonderful prose and interesting ideas.
